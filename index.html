            In 2013, Elisa Lam, a 21-year-old tourist from Vancouver, British
            Columbia, disappeared while staying at the Cecil Hotel, a Los
            Angeles hotel with a long and lurid history. She was last seen on
            January 31, 2013. As part of the police investigation, a video was
            released that showed Lam behaving erratically in a hotel elevator.
            On February 19, 2013, Lam's body was found inside a water tank on
            the roof of the hotel. Her death was later determined to be an
            accidental drowning, though the exact circumstances that led to this
            remain unclear.

            The 6 year-old beauty pageant queen, JonBenét Ramsey, was found
            murdered in her Boulder, Colorado, home on December 26, 1996. She
            was strangled and hit in the head with an unidentifiable object.
            There was no signs of forced entry in the home, no one has ever been
            charged in the case and the investigation is still open. Early
            suspicion fell on her parents, but they were exonerated after DNA at
            the scene was found to belong to a male unrelated to the Ramsey
            family. But, evidence that she had a small amount of pineapple that
            was not digested, suggesting she ate it shortly before her death.
            John Ramsey initially stated that she had arrived at home from the
            party already asleep, and he put her in bed, but the story later
            changed (so, he lied). She was awake at some point, and even if the
            bowl was Burke’s and not hers, she could’ve easily walked by and
            grabbed a piece out of the bowl…not something she would likely have
            done if she were with an intruder.

            On May 3, 2007, 3 year old Madeleine vanished from her bed at her
            family's vacation apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal. The McCanns
            were visiting from the United Kingdom, where they lived. She had
            been left with her 2-year-old twin siblings in the unlocked rental
            while Kate and Gerry dined with friends at a restaurant 130 feet
            away. The parents took turns checking on their children
            periodically, but later that night, Kate noticed an open window and
            Madeleine missing from her bed. She has not been seen since, and the
            investigation is still open.

            North Carolina, United States. In the early morning hours of
            February 14, 2000, for reasons unknown, she packed her bookbag, left
            her family home north of the city and began walking along nearby
            North Carolina Highway 18 despite heavy rain and wind. One witness
            went to approach her and Asha ran into a wooded area. Later in the
            morning, Asha's parents discovered her missing from her bedroom. She
            has not been seen since.
